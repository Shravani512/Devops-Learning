Detailed Explanation of the Data Center Network Diagram

The diagram represents a hybrid IT infrastructure, where multiple Data Centers and Client Centers are connected through routers, switches, firewalls,
and the Internet to handle requests, store data, and maintain secure communication.

1. On-Premise Data Center (Left Side)

Components:

Servers:

WWW Server: Hosts web applications and websites.
File Server: Stores internal files, shared data, and logs.
Database Servers: Store structured data such as user info, transactions, etc.
Communication Servers: Handle internal communication or API traffic.

Networking Devices:

Switch: Connects all internal servers, PCs (Managers, Finance, Monitoring). Works on Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model.
Router: Connects the internal LAN to external networks (WAN/Internet). Works on Layer 3 (Network Layer).
Firewall: Protects the network by filtering malicious or unauthorized traffic before it goes to the internet.

Flow (when request starts here):

1. A Manager or Client System sends a request → goes to Switch.
2. The Switch forwards it to the appropriate Server (e.g., WWW Server).
3. If the server has the requested data → it sends the response back through the same path.
4. If data is **not available** locally → the request is routed to the external Data Center or Cloud via Router & Internet.

2. Secondary / Remote Data Center (Right Side)

Components:

Database Server: Contains backups or extended datasets.
Communication Client: Interacts with main communication servers in the primary data center.
Switch & Router: Facilitate data exchange and manage network traffic.

Flow:

1. When the primary data center doesn’t have the requested data,
   the Router forwards the request via DDN (Dedicated Digital Network) to this remote data center.
2. The remote data center’s servers process the request and fetch or compute the required data.
3. Data is then sent back through the same DDN connection to the primary data center and then to the user.

Purpose:

Backup and disaster recovery
Load balancing and latency reduction
Resource sharing across multiple branches


3. Client Centers (Bottom Left & Right)

Components:

Client systems like Record, Finance, Customs, Others
Local Switches connecting all PCs internally
Routers that connect the client center to the Internet

Flow:

1. User (e.g., Finance team) sends a request from their PC → Switch → Router → Internet.
2. Internet forwards it to the on-premise or cloud data center.
3. The response travels back along the same route.

If data is not available in on-premise:

The data center router forwards the request to remote data centers or cloud-based infrastructure.
The cloud handles the request, retrieves data from scalable cloud servers, and sends it back via the same network path.

4. Firewall and Internet Connectivity (Middle Section)

Components:

Firewall: Sits between the internal data center and external internet.

Filters traffic
Blocks unauthorized access
Logs suspicious activity
Routers: Manage routing between the internal network, remote data centers, and the Internet.

Flow:

1. When data travels from the on-premise server to an external server (like cloud),
   the firewall checks and approves packets based on rules (ports, IPs, protocols).
2. The router determines the best route (either Internet or DDN line).
3. Response packets pass through the firewall again to reach the original requester safely.

End-to-End Request Flow Summary

Let’s combine all compartments into one data journey:

Client Device
   ↓
Local Switch → Router → Internet
   ↓
Firewall → On-Premise Data Center (Servers)
   ↓
If data not found →
   Router → DDN / Internet → Remote Data Center / Cloud
   ↓
Data fetched → returned to On-Premise
   ↓
Firewall → Router → Internet → Client


When Data Moves to Cloud

If your system is hybrid (cloud + on-premise):

1. Data request first checks on-premise servers.
2. If not found, request is routed to the cloud via secure VPN or internet tunnel.
3. Cloud servers (like AWS, Azure, GCP) respond to the query.
4. Response is delivered back to the user through the same chain.
