Subnetting and CIDR Notation 

In networking, every device connected to a network has an IP address.
But managing and organizing these addresses efficiently requires Subnetting and CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing).
These two concepts help optimize IP usage, improve security, and enhance network performance.

🧩 What is Subnetting?

Subnetting means dividing a large network into smaller, manageable parts called subnets.
Each subnet functions as a smaller network within a larger one, improving routing efficiency and control.

Subnetting process:

Main Network (192.168.10.0/24)
          ↓
Divide into 4 Subnets (/26)
          ↓
Assign each Subnet to Department (HR, IT, Sales, Admin)
          ↓
Each Department gets its own range and broadcast address


🧩 What is CIDR Notation?

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a modern way to represent IP addresses and subnet masks.
It replaces the old Class A/B/C system and gives us flexibility to allocate addresses precisely as needed.
eg. IP Address / Prefix Length
Example: 192.168.1.0/24

/24 means the first 24 bits are network bits, and the remaining 8 are host bits.
The subnet mask for /24 is 255.255.255.0.

🧩 Why Subnetting is Needed

Reduces network congestion
Enhances security by isolating departments
Makes IP address management easier
Optimizes performance by reducing broadcast traffic

Example of Subnetting

Let’s say we have a network: 192.168.10.0/24  (24 network bits and 8 host bits)

If you want to divide it into 6 smaller networks
So will have to borrow host bits and increase network bits.

bits need to borrow 2^n >= number of subnets needs to be created. So n=3
so here need to borrow 3 host bits so the slash notation will be
192.168.10.0/27 (27 network bits and 5 host bits)

so now 8 subnets will be created. 2^n

Subnet mask:
1 = 10000000 128
2 = 11000000 192
3 = 11100000 224

step = 256/8 = 32

Subnet 1 = 192.168.10.0
Subnet 2 = 192.168.10.32
Subnet 3 = 192.168.10.64
Subnet 4 = 192.168.10.128
Subnet 5 = 192.168.10.192
Subnet 6 = 192.168.10.224

so subnet mask in 224 as we borrowed 3 host bits

Each subnet will have 64 IP addresses.

Summary:

Subnetting divides networks for better management and security.
CIDR Notation helps define network sizes flexibly.
Together, they optimize IP address allocation and routing.
