Networking in DevOps is the backbone that enables communication between servers, applications, and users. It ensures reliable connectivity, security,
and data flow across environments. Understanding networking helps DevOps engineers manage infrastructure, troubleshoot issues, and optimize performance 
in cloud and CI/CD setups.

1. Global Internet Infrastructure 
2. Understanding the OSI and TCP/IP models
3. Working of routers and switches
4. Basics of cloud networking and on-premises infrastructure

Global Internet Infrastructure 

Undersea Cables (Southeast Asia–Middle East–Western Europe, India-Asia-Xpress, India-Europe-Xpress by Reliance Jio)
     ↓
Tier 1 Backbone (AT&T, Verizon, Level 3 Communications (Lumen), Tata Communications, NTT Communications)
     ↓
Tier 2 Regional ISPs   (Airtel, Vodafone Idea, BSNL)
     ↓
Tier 3 Local ISPs (JioFiber, Hathway, You Broadband)
     ↓
Home Modem & Router (D-Link, Airtel Xstream Fiber Router)
     ↓
User Devices (Laptops, Mobiles) 

The global internet infrastructure connects users worldwide through a layered network system. Data travels first via undersea fiber-optic cables linking
continents, then through Tier 1 backbone providers that form the internet’s core. Tier 2 ISPs distribute connectivity regionally, while Tier 3 ISPs deliver 
it to homes and local users. The home modem and router convert signals into usable internet connections. Finally, user devices like laptops and mobiles access
the web through these interconnected layers.
