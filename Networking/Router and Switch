Routers and switches are essential devices that help transfer data efficiently between computers and networks. Though they both forward data, 
they operate at different layers of the OSI model and serve different purposes.

👉 Switch: The Local Traffic Controller

A Switch connects multiple devices (computers, printers, servers) within the same local area network (LAN).
It works at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and uses MAC addresses to identify where to send data frames.

working-

Device A → sends data to Device B
        ↓
Switch receives data frame
        ↓
Reads destination MAC address
        ↓
Checks MAC address table
        ↓
Forwards frame only to Device B’s port

---------------------------------------------------------

👉 Router — The Network Gateway

A Router connects multiple networks (like your home LAN to the Internet).
It works at the Network Layer (Layer 3) and uses IP addresses to route data packets to their correct destinations across different networks.

Working-

PC (192.168.1.5) → wants to reach google.com (142.250.x.x)
          ↓
Router checks IP address and routing table
          ↓
Encapsulates packet with next-hop IP
          ↓
Forwards it to the Internet (ISP)
          ↓
Receives response packet and routes it back to the correct LAN device

Device	Layer	Uses Address	Function:

Switch->	Layer 2 (Data Link)	uses MAC Address to Connects devices within a LAN
Router->	Layer 3 (Network)	uses IP Address to Connects multiple networks (LAN ↔ WAN)

👉A Switch manages data traffic inside your network.
👉A Router manages data traffic between networks.
