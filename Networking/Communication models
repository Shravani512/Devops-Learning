Understanding the OSI and TCP/IP Models in Networking

When we talk about computer networks, data doesn’t just “travel” randomly — it follows specific layers and rules. Two of the most important models 
that define how data moves across a network are the OSI Model and the TCP/IP Model. Let’s understand both in a simple and practical way.

👉 What is the OSI Model?

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that defines how data is transmitted between computers over a network. 
It divides the communication process into 7 distinct layers, each with a specific role.

7 Layers of the OSI Model

| Layer | Name               | Function                                      | Example                         |
| :---: | :------------------| :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
|   7   | Application Layer  | User interaction with network applications    | Web browser (HTTP, FTP, SMTP)   |
|   6   | Presentation Layer | Data translation, encryption, compression     | SSL/TLS encryption, JPEG, ASCII |
|   5   | Session Layer      | Establishes and manages sessions              | Session management in web apps  |
|   4   | Transport Layer    | Reliable delivery, error checking             | TCP, UDP                        |
|   3   | Network Layer      | Logical addressing and routing                | IP, Routers                     |
|   2   | Data Link Layer    | Physical addressing (MAC), error detection    | Ethernet, Switches              |
|   1   | Physical Layer     | Transmission of raw bits over physical medium | Cables, Wi-Fi, Hubs             |

Mnemonic to Remember:

👉 All People Seem To Need Data Processing
(Application → Presentation → Session → Transport → Network → Data Link → Physical)

What is the TCP/IP Model?

The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) model is a practical implementation used in the real world. It’s simpler, 
with 4 layers, and is the foundation of the modern internet.

👉 4 Layers of the TCP/IP Model

| Layer | Function             | Example Protocols                      |                              |
| :---: | :--------------------| :------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
|   4   | Application Layer    | Handles user-level protocols           | HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP         |
|   3   | Transport Layer      | Ensures reliable communication         | TCP, UDP                     |
|   2   | Internet Layer*      | Responsible for addressing and routing | IP, ICMP, ARP                |
|   1   | Network Access Layer | Physical transmission of data          | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Frame Relay |

Comparison: OSI vs TCP/IP

| Feature           | OSI Model                    | TCP/IP Model                         |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Layers            | 7                            | 4                                    |
| Developed By      | ISO                          | DARPA (U.S. Department of Defense)   |
| Use               | Theoretical model            | Practical model (used in real world) |
| Example Protocols | HTTP, FTP, SMTP (top layers) | TCP, IP, DNS, ARP                    |
| Relationship      | Conceptual reference         | Actual implementation                |


How They Work Together**

When you send a message or file:

1. It starts at the Application Layer**\\ (user interaction).
2. Moves down through each layer where it’s packaged with necessary headers and info.
3. Travels through the **network** (routers, switches, cables).
4. The receiving device then unwraps it layer by layer until it reaches the app again.

Each layer only communicates with its **corresponding layer** on the other device — this is called **peer-to-peer communication**.

👉 Real-Life Analogy

At Sender Side:

Application Layer (protocols http, smtp etc)
       ↓
Transport Layer (adds header containing source and destination port number and breaks data into segments)
       ↓
Internet Layer (adds IP address, routing info)
       ↓
Network Access Layer (adds MAC address, converts to bits)
(till this layer everything happens on sender device)
       ↓
Physical Medium (frome device to wifi through radio waves this is then sent by NIC to receiver by electrical signals)

At Receiver Side:

Network Access Layer (reads bits, removes MAC info)
        ↓
Internet Layer (checks IP address, routes to host)
        ↓
Transport Layer (reassembles data, checks for errors)
        ↓
Application Layer (delivers data to the receiving app)

Data from the sender passes through the TCP/IP layers where headers and addresses are added for delivery. The Network Access Layer converts data into
bits and transmits it via physical media to the receiver. At the receiver’s end, each layer removes its respective headers and processes the data step
by step. Finally, the Application Layer delivers the reassembled message to the intended application.
