In Linux, volumes are the basic building blocks for storing, organizing, and managing data on disks. Whether you're managing a personal server
or enterprise-grade storage, understanding volumes is crucial for efficient storage management.

What is a Volume in Linux?

A volume is a storage unit that your operating system uses to store files. In Linux, volumes are typically created on partitions, logical volumes (LVM), or physical disks. Volumes abstract the underlying hardware, allowing flexibility in storage allocation, resizing, and management.
Key point: A volume can be smaller or larger than a disk partition and can span multiple disks using LVM.

Volume Management Commands

Command	Purpose
lsblk	        ->        Lists all block devices and volumes
df -h	        ->        Shows disk space usage for mounted volumes
mount         ->       	Mounts a volume to a directory
umount        ->       	Unmounts a volume
pvcreate, vgcreate, lvcreate	        ->       Create physical, volume groups, and logical volumes
lvextend / lvreduce	                  ->       Resize logical volumes
mkfs	                                ->       Format a volume with a filesystem

4. Filesystems on Volumes

Before using a volume, you must format it with a filesystem. Common Linux filesystems include:

ext4             →         Default for most Linux distros
xfs              →         High-performance, used in RHEL/CentOS
btrfs            →         Supports snapshots and checksums
vfat / ntfs      →         Compatible with Windows

Types of volumes:

Physical Volumes

Physical disks or partitions form the foundation.
Used directly by the system or as part of LVM.

Command: fdisk -l    Lists all physical disks and partitions

fdisk -l 

-----------------------------------------------

Logical Volume

Logical Volumes (LVM)

Allows combining multiple physical volumes into volume groups (VG).
Logical volumes (LV) can be resized dynamically without affecting data.

Example:

Create a physical volume
sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb
      |
Create a volume group
sudo vgcreate vg_data /dev/sdb
      |
Create a logical volume
sudo lvcreate -L 10G -n lv_storage vg_data
      |
Format and mount
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_data/lv_storage
sudo mount /dev/vg_data/lv_storage /mnt/storage

-------------------------------------------------

Swap Volumes

Special volumes used by Linux as virtual memory.
Helps the system when RAM is full.

Example:

sudo mkswap /dev/sda2
sudo swapon /dev/sda2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mounting Volumes

A volume must be mounted to access its files. Mount points are directories where the volume’s filesystem appears.

sudo mkdir /mnt/folderForMounting
Sudo mount source destionation eg. sudo mount /dev/vg_data/lv_storage /mnt/data
