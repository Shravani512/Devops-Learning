Assignment1: Create 3 volumes and mount for use in 2 ways-
                 1. Logical mounting
                 2. Disk mounting

Scenario:
v1 and v2 are combined into a Volume Group (VG) and a Logical Volume (LV) is created and mounted logically for use.
v3 remains a standalone physical volume and is mounted directly as a disk.


Create 3 volumes v1, v2, v3 on AWS
          |
[Step 1: PV Creation]
  pvcreate /dev/xvdf /dev/xvdg /dev/xvdh
          |
          v
[Step 2: VG Creation (v1+v2 only)]
  vgcreate vg_data /dev/xvdf /dev/xvdg
          |
          v
[Step 3: LV Creation for Data]
  lvcreate -L 5G -n lv_data1 vg_data
          |
          v
[Step 4: Logical Mounting of LV]
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_data/lv_data1
  mkdir /mnt/data1
  mount /dev/vg_data/lv_data1 /mnt/data1
          |
          v
error: Physical volume "/dev/xvdh" not found
solution: 1. Add it to existing Volume Group (sudo vgextend vg_data /dev/xvdh)
          2. remove physical vol which is not added in group (vgreduce --removemissing xvdh)
