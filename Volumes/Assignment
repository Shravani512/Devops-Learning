Assignment1: Create 3 volumes and mount for use in 2 ways-
                 1. Logical mounting
                 2. Disk mounting

Logical mounting: 
Logical mounting refers to mounting a Logical Volume (LV) that is created using LVM (Logical Volume Manager). The LV is an abstraction over physical
volumes (PVs) and volume groups (VGs), which allows for flexible storage allocation like resizing, snapshots, and combining multiple disks.
Uses LVM layers: PV → VG → LV → Mount point

Disk mounting:
Disk mounting refers to mounting a physical disk or partition directly to a directory, without LVM abstraction. The OS interacts with the disk directly
as a block device.
No LVM involved, just format and mount the raw disk

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario:
v1 and v2 are combined into a Volume Group (VG) and a Logical Volume (LV) is created and mounted logically for use.
v3 remains a standalone physical volume and is mounted directly as a disk.

Logical mpounting:

Create 3 volumes v1, v2, v3 on AWS
          |
[Step 1: PV Creation]
  pvcreate /dev/xvdf /dev/xvdg /dev/xvdh
          |
          v
[Step 2: VG Creation (v1+v2 only)]
  vgcreate vg_data /dev/xvdf /dev/xvdg
          |
          v
[Step 3: LV Creation for Data]
  lvcreate -L 5G -n lv_data1 vg_data
          |
          v
[Step 4: Logical Mounting of LV]
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_data/lv_data1
  mkdir /mnt/data1
  mount /dev/vg_data/lv_data1 /mnt/data1
          |
          v
error: Physical volume "/dev/xvdh" not found
solution: 1. Add it to existing Volume Group (sudo vgextend vg_data /dev/xvdh)
          2. remove physical vol which is not added in group (vgreduce --removemissing xvdh)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disk mounting:

[Step 1: Attach Physical Disk]
   (e.g., /dev/xvdh)
          |
          v
[Step 2: Verify Disk]
   Command: lsblk
          |
          v
[Step 3: Format Disk with Filesystem]
   Command: mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdh
          |
          v
[Step 4: Create Mount Point]
   Command: mkdir -p /mnt/data3
          |
          v
[Step 5: Mount Disk]
   Command: mount /dev/xvdh /mnt/data3
          |
          v
[Step 6: Verify Mounted Disk]
   Command: df -h | grep /mnt/data3
