Understanding Operating Systems (OS)

An Operating System (OS) is the main software that manages all hardware and software on a computer. It acts as a bridge between the user and the
computer hardware — controlling how applications use system resources like CPU, memory, and storage.

💻 Types of Operating Systems
1. Client Operating System

Installed on personal devices like laptops, desktops, or smartphones.
Designed for individual users.
Examples: Windows 11, macOS, Ubuntu Desktop, Android
Main focus: User interface, applications, and ease of use.

2. Server Operating System

Installed on powerful machines (servers) to provide services to multiple clients or users over a network.
Designed for performance, security, and reliability.
Examples: Windows Server, Ubuntu Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS
Main focus: Managing multiple users, handling databases, web hosting, file sharing.

How Linux Came Into Existence

In 1991, a student named Linus Torvalds from Finland wanted a free and open-source alternative to UNIX.
He created a small OS kernel and shared it online for collaboration.
Developers around the world contributed, and this project became known as Linux.
So, LINUS (person) → created LINUX (OS).

Why Linux Became Popular:

Free & Open Source
Secure and Stable
Runs on everything — from servers to Android phones.

Linux Setup

Install Linux OS on your local system — as Linux is as secure as your blood!

Ways to set up Linux:

1. Virtual Box or Oracle VM – Make a virtual box of Oracle and install image of Linux (.iso file).
2. Vagrant Tool – Vagrant can help using Linux virtually.
3. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) – Windows now gives Linux support also within Windows (included in Windows 10 and 11).
4. Dual Boot – We can install Linux alongside Windows and choose at startup which OS to use.
5. Cloud Setup – We can make our Linux run on cloud services like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

✅ We will be going ahead with option (5)

⚙️ Explanation (in few lines)

The Kernel is the core part of an operating system.
It connects user applications to the hardware.
It controls everything — CPU scheduling, memory allocation, file access, and device communication.
You can think of it as the “engine” of your OS — hidden but always running.

🌍 Real-world Use

In Android phones, the Linux kernel manages apps, memory, and hardware (camera, Wi-Fi, battery).
In servers, the kernel ensures smooth multitasking and security.
In computers, it helps multiple programs run efficiently without crashing.
