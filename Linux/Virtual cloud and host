Understanding Virtual Cloud, Public & Private Hosts, and Bastion Host:

In modern cloud architectures, security and controlled access to resources are critical. Organizations often deploy resources in public and private
networks within a virtual cloud environment, using tools like a Bastion Host to maintain secure access. Let’s break down these concepts.

What is a Virtual Cloud?

A Virtual Cloud is a software-defined infrastructure that mimics a physical network in the cloud. It provides:

Isolation: Different resources (servers, databases, applications) can run in separate virtual networks.
Scalability: Easily add or remove servers or services as needed.
Security: Control access using subnets, security groups, and firewalls.
Example: AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), Azure Virtual Network, GCP VPC.

A virtual cloud typically has public and private subnets:

Public Subnet: Resources here can communicate with the internet via an Internet Gateway. Examples: web servers, load balancers.
Private Subnet: Resources here cannot access the internet directly; often used for databases, application servers, and sensitive data.

Public and Private Hosts

In cloud environments, servers are categorized based on their accessibility:

Public Host

Has a public IP address.
Accessible directly from the internet.
Examples: Web servers, bastion hosts.
Risks: Exposed to attacks if not properly secured.

Private Host

Has only a private IP address.
Not directly reachable from the internet.
Typically communicates internally within the virtual cloud.
Examples: Database servers, application servers.

What is a Bastion Host?

A Bastion Host (also called a jump server) is a special-purpose server used to securely access private hosts in a cloud environment.

Purpose

Acts as a bridge between public internet and private network.
Reduces attack surface by limiting direct access to private servers.

How it Works

You connect to the Bastion Host using SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows).
From the Bastion Host, you access the private hosts in the private subnet.
This ensures:
No direct exposure of private hosts to the internet.
Centralized logging of access for auditing purposes.

A Bastion Host is the secure gateway to access private hosts inside a virtual cloud. By separating resources into public and private subnets, organizations
can protect sensitive data while still allowing necessary access. Understanding this architecture is essential for cloud security and managing 
infrastructure effectively.

Access: Needs a secure path (like VPN or Bastion Host) to connect from outside.
