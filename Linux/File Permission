Linux File Permission Table

In Linux, each file/directory has permissions for Owner (User), Group, and Others. Permissions are of three types:

Permission	Symbol	Description

Read	r	   ->  Can read the file / list directory contents
Write	w    ->  Can modify the file / add/remove files in directory
Execute	x	 ->  Can execute the file / access directory

commands:

chown user file
chgrp group file
ls -l      -> Shows permissions in symbolic form
ls -la     -> Includes hidden files

0	   0	 0	 0	No permission

chmod 600 file.txt   ->   Set owner=rw, group=none, others=none
chmod 777 file.txt   ->   Full permissions for everyone
