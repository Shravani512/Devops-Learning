Users and Groups in Linux

What is a User?

Linux is a multi-user operating system, which means multiple people can use the same system at the same time — each having different access levels and permissions.
To manage this efficiently, Linux uses Users and Groups.

A user is an individual account that can log in and perform actions on the system.
Each user has:

1. A username
2. A user ID (UID)
3. A home directory
4. A default shell
5. Permissions that control what they can access or modify.

👉 Every user’s information is stored in:
/etc/passwd

create user
sudo useradd username
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is a Group?

A group is a collection of users.
It allows you to manage permissions for multiple users at once — instead of assigning them individually.

👉 Group information is stored in:
/etc/group

sudo groupadd developers

sudo useradd -m -G developers user1
sudo usermod -aG user2 developers

Important Files

/etc/passwd->	  Stores user account details
/etc/shadow->	  Stores encrypted passwords
